\section{Wealth}

\begin{multicols}{2}\label{sec:inv-wealth}
Gil is the currency present in most Final Fantasy games. Depending on how technologically advanced the world is, it can take many forms: gold coins, paper money, checks, planetary credit\ldots{} Regardless of Gil’s actual format, it will be an abstraction for monetary values.

Gil is a character reward as important as experience. Many Jobs take into account not only the Stat levels, but also the character’s equipment and items to measure their power. Depriving an~\nameref{subsec:pjob-archer}, for example, of a suitable weapon can make the character feel extremely weak in comparison to a Mage. Imagine an~\nameref{subsec:sjob-alchemist} who don’t even have an item to use? Gil is such an important reward that there is a Job dedicated to it: the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue}.

\subsection{Mundane Items}\label{subsec:inv-mundane}
How much does a mundane item cost? How many feet of rope, how many torches, how many sleeping bags a character has or may possess? The answer has to do directly with the economy of a Final Fantasy world: \textbf{mundane items are free}.

Everything that costs Gil refers to combat. All other items should be designed according to the context and the Challenges and Destiny system, starting at page~\pageref{sec:challenges}. Mundane items are a tool for the Game Master to use in drama; they were never important in any game in the series, unless the situation said so. If you decide that your character should have a torch, they will. If it is important that your character does not have a torch, they will not. If you are unsure, use a Challenge. Maybe the Bottomless Pockets Quirk may help.

This does not mean that the characters have access to everything. For example: an aircraft is not combat-related and therefore is a “mundane item” is not available to the characters unless the Game Master decides so. Players can’t simply demand to own something simply because the item is mundane and therefore “free” as in our example aircraft. Use that desire to create an adventure --- or a small campaign arc, perhaps --- and then give them the aircraft. Use the acquisition of the aircraft to support the history and not as an accounting exercise.

That's the spirit of mundane items: something that helps you tell a story, not an exercise to prepare the best shopping list. Nothing prevents, however, NPCs to pay big bucks for a mundane item. In fact, some wealthy patrons might be willing to pay good sums of Gil for a frame, or a jewel or a miniaturized reactor that have no value for player characters. Go figure!

\subsection{Acquiring Gil}\label{subsec:inv-acquire}
You can earn Gil in many ways. As a mission’s reward; as spoils after the defeat of enemies; in chests or otherwise scattered in dungeons; by selling items; among other possibilities. During character creation, each player can spend 200 Gil in equipment and items. After this, it is recommended that for each experience point gained by the character, he should gain 8 Gil. This amount of Gil is enough to keep up with the proper equipment to their level and to buy enough healing and battle items. However, the Game Master may adjust this amount, increasing or decreasing it, to the reality of the gameplay.

Use spoils as a way randomize a bit the Gil rewards. In every combat encounter, assign one or more items as enemy’s booty. At the end of combat, after winning it, the group will roll a d100 against a set difficulty. If the die result is greater than the difficulty, they get the item(s) marked as spoils. When including spoils, multiply its value and the chance to earn it: the result is the spoils’ real value, which should be deducted from the encounter total. For example, if the Game Master decide that an encounter will give two thousand and five hundred Gil as reward and include a \tequip{Desert Ring} (worth 1,000 Gil) as spoils, with difficulty 40 (and hence 60\% chance of being obtained), they must deduct the value of six hundred Gil (60\% of 1,000). Thus, the group will receive 1,900 Gil and may earn a \tequip{Desert Ring} (or not). % chktex 36

Game Master, do not be afraid to include spoils in your game and use its randomness. In the above example, regardless of whether they got the \tequip{Desert Ring} or not, consider they received the 2,500 Gil. In the long run, the characters’ power will be the same. However, items with 100\% chance of being obtained count as normal reward, not as spoils. In the previous example, the Game Master could decide that, besides the chance to gain the \tequip{Desert Ring}, the fight would grant two Hi-Potions (150 Gil each). Thus, the combat reward would be 1,600 Gil, two Hi-Potions, and the spoils (\tequip{Desert Ring}, difficulty 40). Finally, remember that items’ sales price is half their purchase cost.

\subsection{Gil and the Rogue}\label{subsec:inv-rogue}
Early in the game, the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue} earns an Ability that directly influences the acquisition of Gil. \tability{Gilionaire}, \taction{Steal} and \tability{Treasure Hunter} are ways in which the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue} increases the amount of Gil available for the group. This translates into better and stronger items more quickly than compared with a rogueless group. However, the three skills work differently and require a different preparation from the Game Master.

\tability{Gilionaire} is the simplest of them. Whenever the group receives a Gil reward, for any reason, increase by 25\% the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue}’s share. For example, a group of four players defeat a monster and the Game Master says the monster’s horns are valuable and can be sold for a total of 4,000 Gil. If there is a~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue} with this Ability in the group, their share (1,000 Gil) is increased by 25\% --- to 1,250 Gil. Thus, when selling the horns, the group collects 4,250 Gil, not 4,000. Similarly, people are willing to pay more for the same service, and the chests are inexplicably bigger. \tability{Gilionaire} is always active, and it is the least risky way to increase Gil received.

\begin{center}
    \adjincludegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{block-goldbag}
\end{center}

\tability{Treasure Hunter} is the second way the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue} can increase the group’s wealth. At the end of combat, when the group trying to gain spoils, the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue} can roll the die again, increasing the chance or even giving them the opportunity to gain double spoils. Compared to \tability{Gilionaire}, \tability{Treasure Hunter} is active in fewer moments because it only allows the~\nameref{subsec:pjob-rogue} to improve the spoils received and does not affect other Gil gains, but can provide more significant bonuses when it works, by handing items that may be crucial when the group simply does not have the time to find a merchant in a safe place.

\taction{Steal} is the last way the Rogue has to increase the group’s wealth. This action also demands a special preparation by the Game Master. When creating a combat encounter, the GM must decide which are the Common item and the Rare item that every enemy will have. This is only required if there is a Rogue with \taction{Steal} in the group. It is not mandatory that each enemy must have both items; it may have only the Common item, only the Rare item, or even neither. Regardless, each enemy can only be stolen once. If the character tries to steal again an enemy who already suffered the effects of \taction{Steal}, it automatically fails.

The definition of which item(s) the enemy will have does not depend on the enemy's ability to use, equip or even physically carry the item; often, characters in Final Fantasy steal swords or even full armor suits from unsuspecting enemies like dragons or chocobos. Compared to \tability{Gilionaire} or \tability{Treasure Hunter}, \taction{Steal} is the most expensive and riskiest action – it costs actions in combat and is more likely to fail --- but it must be the most rewarding, especially if the Rogue obtain the Rare item. In addition, the stolen items go to the inventory and are available for immediate use, even within the combat. % chktex 36

Regardless of how the Rogue earn this extra Gil, the group shall not be punished for having a Rogue. Rogues with \tability{Gilionaire} should earn on average 10 Gil per experience point, and Rogues with the other Abilities could earn even more, depending on their rolls. The Game Master must resist the temptation to give smaller rewards to its players because “The Rogue will steal a difference.”

\section{Equipment}\label{sec:inv-equip}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Equipment is the main use for Gil. Each character can equip exactly one weapon and armor, plus two accessories. In the case of weapons and armor, they are divided into categories. \tequip{Light Armor}, \tequip{Medium Armor} and \tequip{Heavy Armor} are the available armors. Weapons can be classified as \tequip{Light Swords / Knives}, \tequip{Heavy Weapons \& Shield}, \tequip{Heavy Weapons}, \tequip{Polearms}, \tequip{Claws / Gloves}, \tequip{Twin Blades}, \tequip{Bows}, \tequip{Throwing Weapons}, \tequip{Rifle / Crossbows}, \tequip{Staffs}, \tequip{Wands}, and \tequip{Instruments}.

The character’s Abilities indicate which weapons and armor they may equip. If a character wishes to equip a weapon that they may not, it doesn’t add their Offensive Stat to any roll or attack; If a character wishes to equip an armor that they may not, they don’t consider their Defensive Stat in opponents’ rolls or attacks.

All equipment has a minimum level to be used, and most have a Gil cost. The items that do not have Gil costs are so rare that there are only a few copies of each in the world or artifacts so hard to be found that there are at most one, maybe two copies worldwide. Rare and artifact items should be given at the GM’s discretion.

\subsection{Armor}\label{subsec:inv-armor}

Armors are the main defensive equipment. Although some specific armor can empower attacks, their main function is to reduce the damage suffered. All armor pieces have two characteristics: Armor (ARM) and Magic Armor (MARM). Every time you suffer physical damage, decrease the damage by an amount equal to your ARM\@. Every time you suffer magical damage, decrease the damage by an amount equal to your MARM\@. 

\begin{boco}
    For example, a character with MARM 21 suffers a magical attack dealing 46 damage. They lose 25 HP due to their magical protection. Regardless of ARM and MARM values and the damage dealt, every successful attack that deals damage causes a minimal loss of 1 HP\@. As it takes some time to don an armor suit, it is impossible to equip or change armor in combat.
\end{boco}

\subsubsection{Partial Armor Sets}\label{subsec:inv-partial-armor}
As spoils, \taction{Steal} or dungeon reward, the game master may bestow partial armor sets. Maybe you found only the breastplate, or only the helmet of a higher tier equipment. To create a partial armor set, follow those rules:
The stats of the armor (min level, arm, marm) are exactly the average value between the armor and its base counterpart 1-tier lower. The equipment abilities are unchanged. At a blacksmith, you can upgrade a partial armor set to the corresponding full item by paying the gil difference between the full item and its base counterpart 1-tier lower, or sell it for the value of the base counterpart 1-tier lower's full price.

\begin{boco}
You find the breastplate of a Shell Mail. Shell Mail got the following stats: lvl 37, 65 ARM, 28 MARM, Auto Shell. The base lvl 28 armor is the Silver Mail (lvl 28, 36 ARM, 13 MARM). So the Shell Mail (partial) stats are: lvl 32, 50 ARM, 20 MARM, Auto-Shell, and it can be upgraded to a Shell Mail for 5667 gil or sold for 2667 gil (the price of the Silver Mail).
\end{boco}

\end{multicols}

\subsubsection{Light Armor}

This armor is commonly used by Mages and Rune Knightss. Its main purpose is to protect against magical damage, leaving it relatively ineffective against physical damage.

\begin{tabarm}[label=inv-larm]
    \input{revised/generated/arm-light}
\end{tabarm}

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Medium Armor}

This armor type is common between many different Jobs.  It is balanced between physical and magic defenses, leaving no easily exploitable weakness.

\begin{tabarm}[label=inv-marm]
    \input{revised/generated/arm-medium}
\end{tabarm}

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Heavy Armor}

Favoring defense against physical damage, this type of armor is popular among Warriors and Adepts.  However, it does leave the wearer more vulnerable to magical damage.

\begin{tabarm}[label=inv-harm]
    \input{revised/generated/arm-heavy}
\end{tabarm}
\clearpage

\subsection{Weapons}\label{subsec:inv-weapons}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Weapons are the main offensive equipment.  Unlike armor, which are very similar, each type of weapon is quite different from others.  Each type of weapon has an Offensive Stat and a Defensive Stat.  When you use the \taction{Attack} or any other action that specifies a “weapon attack”, you attack using the equipped weapon's Offensive and Defensive Stats unless the action says otherwise.  For example, Flamberge's (a Light Sword / Knife) damage is equal to 10x.  As its Offensive Stat is Air, the damage will be equal to ten times your Air level before any other modifiers.

In addition, the attack and damage type (physical or magical), the element (usually Cut, Puncture, or Crush), and if the attack is Ranged or Melee, all depends on the equipped weapon.

Every action that needs a weapon attack to hit and does not state the action's range (Ranged or Melee) and/or the action's elements uses the base weapon's range and element.  Actions that do state their range and/or element override the base weapon's characteristics.

Many weapons also have special effects.  All effects that modify the weapon's attack or damage only work with the \taction{Attack} action, unless the action says otherwise.  The exceptions to this rule are all effects that increase damage by some Stat level like the Colichemarde and the Soul Eater weapon ability.  Actions that key off weapon damage use the damage increased by the special effect and the Soul Eater applies to all actions made with that weapon that require a weapon attack.

\subsubsection{Light Swords / Knives}

Fast weapons that deal \telem{Puncture}-elemental damage.  Their Offensive and Deffensive Stats are Air.  Due to their weak damage, they are largely a defensive option.  While a character is equipped with one of these weapons, they may use the reaction \taction{Parry}.  It is used when they suffer a physical attack to make a roll Air vs Air at difficulty 40.  If successful, they don't suffer the attack's effects.  These weapons are always Melee.

\subsubsection{Weapons \& Shields}

One-handed swords, axes, hammers, maces and flails, used in conjunction with a reliable shield. Swords and axes deal Cut-elemental damage, while hammers, maces and flails deal Crush-elemental damage. It is considered a primarily defensive option as it doesn’t have high damage. Their Offensive and Defensive Stats are Earth. While you are equipped with these weapons, you can use the reaction \taction{Block}. Use when you are hit by a physical attack. Roll Earth vs Earth, difficulty 40. If successful you do not suffer the effects of the attack.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Heavy Weapons}

Two-handed swords, axes, sledgehammers, pickaxes, scythes and flails that deal physical damage. Swords, axes and scythes deal Cut-elemental damage, hammers and flails deal Crush-elemental damage, while pickaxes deal Puncture-elemental damage. These weapons are the Earth-based choice with the highest damage potential. Its Offensive and Defensive Stats are Earth. This weapon type is widely used by characters who favor offense over defense.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Polearms}

Spears, glaives and other two-handed weapons that deal Puncture-elemental physical damage. You may either use its Offensive Stat as Earth and its Defensive Stat as Air or its Offensive Stat as Air and its Defensive Stat as Earth. Due to its versatility, you must choose whether to attack Earth vs Air or Air vs Earth for each attack with this weapon type. They are a good option for characters that want to be accurate without needing to swap weapons and need high levels in both Air and Earth, as the Warrior.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Claws / Gloves}

Claws and gloves are Monks’ signature weapon, but almost any character can fight well with them. They deal physical damage, with Gloves dealing Crush-elemental and Claws dealing Cut-elemental damage. Its Offensive Stat is Earth, and its Defensive Stat is Air. Its low cost and ease of use make this weapon a good option for characters that don’t want to worry too much about weapons, and its broad spectrum of effects mean that any character can benefit if you choose the right Claw or Glove.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Katanas}

Katanas are a special kind of swords. Unlike normal swords, they are wielded with more finesse, like light swords, and the spirits they contain within can be released for magical effects. Its Offensive stat is Air and its Defensive stat is Earth. Their damage is physical and Cut-elemental.

\subsubsection{Bows}

Archery is one of the main Ranged combat styles. They deal Puncture-elemental physical damage. Its Offensive and Defensive Stats are Air. Since its attacks are Ranged, it can be used to hit flying enemies. It is one of the weapons most commonly used by Archers due to its good damage and variety of effects.

\subsubsection{Throwing Weapons}

Darts, bombs, chakrams, shuriken and javelins that deal Puncture-elemental physical damage. Its Offensive Stat is Earth and its Defensive Stat is Air. Since its attacks are Ranged, it can be used to hit flying enemies. A throwing weapon's \textit{Status Touch}, \textit{Status Strike} and \textit{Critical Spell} abilities apply to all actions made with that weapon that requires a weapon attack, and \textit{Status Touch} and \textit{Status Strike} effects have their duration increased by one round.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Rifles / Crossbows}

This weapon type can represent rifles, muskets, crossbows or a combination of them, depending on the world’s technology. They deal Puncture-elemental physical damage. Its Offensive Stat is Fire and its Defensive Stat is Air. Since its attacks are Ranged, it can be used to hit flying enemies. Archers, Rogues and Alchemists use this weapon type a lot due to its good damage and use of the Fire Stat to attack.

\begin{tabwpn}[label=inv-rifles-crossbows,range=ranged,type=physical,element=puncture,roll=firevair]
    \input{revised/generated/wpn-rifles-crossbows}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Wands}

Wands are quite popular among black mages as they make ranged attacks using your magical energy. They deal Crush-elemental magical damage by rolling Fire vs Fire. Most also allow you to increase your spellcasting options.

\subsubsection{Staves}

Two-handed weapons that attack using your magical energy. They deal Crush-elemental magical damage. Its Offensive Stat is Fire and its Defensive Stat is Water. They deal good damage and are popular among various characters who can’t use Spells offensively, like White Mages. Most staves can cast Spells, granting the wielder versatility and power.

\subsubsection{Instruments}

Artists’ exclusive weapon type. They deal Cut-elemental magical damage. Its Offensive and Defensive Stats are Water. Being the only weapon able to attack using Water as Offensive Stat, they are highly valued by Artists, despite its low damage output. They are Ranged weapons, and therefore can hit flying enemies.

\begin{tabwpn}[label=inv-instruments,range=ranged,type=magical,element=cut,roll=watervwater]

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Twin Blades}

Dervish’s exclusive weapon type, the ability to fight with two one-handed blades at the same time involves much more than just training. When attacking with them, you deal Cut-elemental physical damage. These weapons are the Air-based choice with the highest damage potential. Its Offensive and Defensive Stats are Air. It is very difficult to defend against such weapons, and once per round, the attacker may roll a weapon attack twice and take the better result.

\begin{tabwpn}[label=inv-twin-blades,range=melee,type=physical,element=cut,roll=airvair]
    \input{revised/generated/wpn-twin-blades}
\end{tabwpn}
\clearpage

\subsection{Accessories}\label{subsec:inv-accessories}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Each character can equip up to two accessories at the same time.  However, the equipment's magic interferes with each other.  Thus, if two accessories or an accessory and another piece of equipment including a weapon or armor would have the same effect, they do not stack.  Only the most powerful item of this type will affect you.  Similarly if a character equips three or more accessories, their effects cancel each other and the character will not receive the benefits of any of them.  For example, if a character equips the Wyglar armor (+ 20\% Max HP) and the Orrachea Armlet (+ 10\% Max HP), the HP increase is only 20\%.

Morever, if two distinct pieces of equipment impart opposite effects only the negative effect will be gained.  For example, if a character is equipped with an accessory granting \tstatus{Mute} immunity and an armor with SOS-\tstatus{Mute}, that character will be immune to the \tstatus{Mute} status until their HP is below 25\%, but once their HP drops below 25\% will suffer the \tstatus{Mute} and lose their immunity.

Although it may seem simple, equipping an accessory requires the character to spend at least a few minutes focusing on its magic.  Thus, it is impossible to equip or change accessories in the middle of a combat.

\section{Inventory}\label{sec:inv-inventory}

\begin{multicols}{2}
All items the group possess who are not equipped on a character are part of the Inventory. In addition to spare equipment, the Inventory contain consumables, such as potions, elixirs and battle items. The Inventory is a group shared resource, such as Destiny points. Thus, if the group has a potion in the Inventory, any character in the group may use the \taction{Draw} action to retrieve it. Consumables are spent after one use.

Every group should devote a part of the obtained Gil to purchase consumables for the Inventory. Even for groups capable of emulating all consumable effects through Spells and Abilities, you never know when the White Mage will drop to 0 HP and the Monk will need to use a Phoenix Down.

Not having an Inventory suitable to the challenges ahead is a sure way to shorten the group's lifespan. Having the right items to use when the occasion requires it can dramatically increase the group’s combat ability. Another advantage in favor of consumables is that they do not have minimum levels to be used, allowing a group to gain powers beyond the usual in dire circumstances.

\begin{center}
    \adjincludegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{block-pumpkinsale}
\end{center}

\begin{boco}
Optional Rule: \textbf{Individual Inventory} \pc%

Some groups do not like the shared Inventory rule. In that case, you may play with each character having its own individual items. If you use this rule, any character may use \taction{Draw} to draw an item from his own inventory and give to another player with a single action, but the player who received the item still must use the \taction{Item} action to use the consumable or equip the weapon. \pw%

Optional Rule: \textbf{Carrying Capacity} \pc%

By default, there is no limit about how many items a character or a group may carry. This mimics the videogames and allows for quicker play. However, if you do want to enforce carrying limits when using the aforementioned Individual Inventory rule, treat the maximum number of consumables a character may carry as two times his Earth level. Alchemists use their highest Stat level instead of Earth to calculate how many items they can carry. \pc%

If you want to enforce the Carrying Capacity rule with the default Shared Inventory option, consider the group's total carrying limit as the sum of each character's individual carrying capacity. \pc%

Characters carrying more items than their carrying capacity suffer increased difficulty in all their attacks, reactions and physical Challenges.
