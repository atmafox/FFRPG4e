    \subsection{Mimicry}\label{subsec:perf-mimicry}

	Unlike the other performances, a mimicry can be Quick or Slow, Ranged or Melee, physical or magical actions. When using a mimicry to repeat an action of another character, the performance repeats all the action’s characteristics. In addition, you should spend all the necessary resources to use the action, be it an item, HP or MP.\@{}Furthermore, depending on the performance, it may even be a reaction or even not an action at all, simply modifying the effects of other actions. If the mimicked action was a weapon attack, you attack with your own weapon.
    
    \textit{Mimic} is a level 1 mimicry. This action may only be used if the action performed this round immediately before your turn was carried out by an ally. You repeat the ally’s action, with the same target.
    
    \textit{Mirror Mimic} is a level 1 mimicry. This action may only be used if the action performed this round immediately before your turn was conducted by an enemy.

When you use any mimicry to create an effect that deals \telem{Fire}, \telem{Ice}, \telem{Lightning}, \telem{Bio}, \telem{Light}, \telem{Shadow}, \telem{Air}, \telem{Water} or \telem{Earth}-elemental damage, you may swap the action’s element for another element of this list.
    
    \textit{Sketch} is a level 3 mimicry. You repeat an enemy’s action, with the same target. You may target the enemy who performed the action, instead of the original target. This may repeat any actions that were taken in this combat.

The discarded initiative die may have any value.
    
    \textit{Command Mimic} is a level 5 mimicry. Once per combat, before the start of first round, as a free action, you may choose an Ability of any ally.
