    \tspec{Surprise Assault}: Requires Earth level 3. Whenever you declare a Slow action, you may reduce its charge time to zero by increasing another of your initiative dice's value by action's charge time. This ability fails if it would increase a die to a value of 11 or greater. \\

    \tspec{Feign Weakness}: Requires Earth level 7. Whenever an opponent misses an attack against you or you avoid its effects by reacting, you may force the opponent to discard one initiative die and immediately repeat the attack against only you (even if the attack targets a Group, it will only target you when you use False Weakness). \\
