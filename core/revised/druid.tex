Unlike the other arcane jobs, these mages fuel their powers from their connection with nature. They are often overlooked or misunderstood by other magicians. Their power derives primarily from experimentation with nature and contact with the monsters and the environment around them. They are quite different, but typically have high values on Earth and Water. \\
