\section{Quirks}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{ffcolpage}
Quirks are characteristics that define your character's personality and/or backstory. They give the player some tips on how to roleplay their character and are a tool both to earn Destiny Points and to use them. Some Quirk also got a keyword. You may not have more than one quirk with the same keyword, so you can't be Caustic and Empathic at the same time. And absolutely no Half-Viera/Half-Elvaan, please! \pc

Destiny Points are a shared group resource that may be used to give the players some control in the narrative. They may be used to turn a failed Challenge into a successful one, to give tips and directions, to perform heroic actions that surpass human capacity and even to cheat death, among various other uses. Details on how to earn and how to spend Destiny Points are on the Game Engine Chapter, starting at page 13.

\tquirk{Bangaa (racial)}: A people of biped lizard men. They are as tall as humans, but significantly stronger and covered with hard scales. You may use Destiny Points due to your great strength, leathery skin and high strength to overcome physical Challenges. However, your race has a terrible vision and it is not uncommon for Bangaa to cover their eyes to focus only on hearing and smell. Although you can still see, but the lack of an accurate vision may cause you problems, and if that happens, earn Destiny Points.
\end{minipage}\quirkimage{race-bangaa} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Bottomless Pockets}: You usually have everything always at hand. Spend Destiny Points to find things you did not expect, as that wrench you were just looking for!

They are generally smaller and more muscular than humans, possessing an innate aptitude for metallurgy and technology.

\end{minipage}\quirkimage{race-lalafell} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}

You may spend Destiny Points to gather information or send messages through Mognet to other moogle. However, their spoken language heavily depends on the kupo word, which can have several meanings depending on the intonation and body movements.

\end{minipage}\quirkimage{race-moogle} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Naive Idealist}: You see life through the lens of a personal code of conduct, or some religious fanaticism, or an ideological utopia.

\end{ffcolpage} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Natural Hunter (animal)}: You feel more comfortable away from civilization. Forests are your second home. You can use Destiny Points to hunt, seek shelter and track in natural environments. However, you are already so used to kill animals that they avoid you and feel uncomfortable around you. If this causes you problems, earn Destiny points.
\end{ffcolpage} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Nu Mou (racial)}: They have similarities with dogs, with elongated snouts, furry tails and big, floppy, ears. Their short stature, around a meter and a half tall, and their tendency to a stooped posture, cause them to be very small. They have a fragile constitution, but they are very intelligent and tend to live three times more than normal humans.

\tquirk{Roegadyn (racial)}: Also known as Galka, this race with slightly ursine appearance has huge bodies, often over two meters tall. Despite their great strength and power, they are renowned for self-knowledge and phlegm. You may use Destiny Points in situations involving self-control and great physical strength. But often their overly calm attitude may look like apathy or simply laziness. Whenever this causes you problems, earn Destiny Points.
\end{minipage}\quirkimage{race-roegadyn} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Straight Arrow (honesty)}: You're a straight arrow, rarely lie and got a reputation for honesty. You may spend Destiny Points to make people believe and trust you. Earn Destiny points whenever your honesty causes you problems.

\end{ffcolpage} \pw \begin{minipage}{.35\textwidth-2\columnsep}
\tquirk{Viera (racial)}: The Viera have two sub-races. The most common live in temperate forests and has long rabbit ears, but there is a sub-race that lives in tropical jungles and has feline characteristics rather than rabbit’s. This sub-breed is commonly called Mithra or Miqo'te. Regardless of the sub-race, they are mostly female, with males being only about twenty percent of the population. Moreover, they are closely linked to the forests and jungles where they live. You may use Destiny Points to communicate with trees, although their cognitive ability is very limited. On the other hand, you feel extremely uncomfortable in urban environments, and can even become ill if you stay away from the natural environment for a long time. Whenever this causes you problems, earn Destiny Points.
\end{minipage}\quirkimage{race-viera} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Visions}: For some reason, you have visions that can give you tips of the future or just torture you. Spend Destiny Points for good visions and earn Destiny Points when flashbacks cause you trouble.
\end{ffcolpage} \pw \begin{ffcolpage}
You may also want to create your own Quirks. Choose a trait that defines your character and talk with your GM to turn into a Quirk. However, there are three guidelines that should be followed. First, a Quirk must be able to provide the player ways to spend Destiny Points to overcome Challenges; second, a quirk must be able to provide the GM ways to create problems for the group; and lastly, a quirk may not influence tactical combat rolls.
\end{ffcolpage}

\section{Stats and Skills}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsection{Stats}
Characters have four Stats, each connected to a crystal - Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Each Stat has a value and levels. For every 10 points in its value, the Stat earns another level. Stat's value varies from 0 to 255 and, consequently, between 0 and 25 levels. The sum of a character’s Stat levels is his Character level. \pc

For example, a 30th level character may have Earth 52 (5th level), Air 108 (10th level), Fire 80 (8th level) and Water 75 (7th level). Each Stat has 6 skills associated to it. The sum of all Skill levels a character has in all skills linked to a particular Stat may not be higher than its Stat level. Thus, the above character has 10 points to spend in all skills but may not spend more than 5 points in Earth skills, no more than 8 points in Fire skills and no more than 7 points in Water Skills. \pc

Stats are also used in the tactical combat system. Each roll in combat uses one Offensive and one Defensive Stat. Earth is usually the Offensive Stat for attacks that depends on the user's brute force and physicality and is the Defensive Stat to attacks that may be prevented by the defender's physical strength, health and
muscle power. \pc

Attacks that rely on the user's speed, finesse and skill use Air as its Offensive Stat. It is the Defensive Stat against attacks that may be evaded by the defender's reflexes and agility. A primarily Offensive Stat, Fire is used in attacks that rely on the user's intelligence and magical ability. If an attack may be avoided by the defender's insight, it uses Fire as it Defensive Stat. \pc

Lastly, attacks that depends on the user's charisma and willpower to hit uses Water as its Offensive Stat. However, it is a mainly Defensive Stat, as attacks that may be resisted by the user's mental strength and magical defenses should use it. Besides its offense and defense implications, players should note that your Earth Value is added to your hit points (HP) and your Water Value is added to your magic points (MP) value. \pc

Stats are increased using experience points. The cost to increase a Stat's value by a single point is one plus twice the Stat level. Thus, a Stat costs 1 experience point per Stat point while at level 0 (value from 0 to 9); 3 experience points per Stat point while at level 1 (value 10 to 19); 5 XP per Stat point while at level 2 (value 20 to 29); and so on. Starting on page 125, there is a table with the total XP cost for each Stat value. \pc

\subsection{Skills}
\begin{ffcolpage}
Skills are tools that the characters have to overcome Challenges. Each Challenge must relate to a Skill. Each Skill level means the player may re-roll once a Challenge related to that Skill. For example, a character with 3 levels in Strength Skill can re-roll the d100 3 times to overcome Strength Challenges. \pc

Earth Skills involve brute strength, toughness, physical prowess and bulk. A character's Earth level is his limit to spend points in \tskill{Strength}, \tskill{Climbing}, \tskill{Swimming}, \tskill{Intimidation}, \tskill{Tolerance}, or \tskill{Jumping}. \pc

Air Skills involve movement, finesse and body coordination. A character's Air level is his limit to spend points in \tskill{Running}, \tskill{Stealth}, \tskill{Piloting}, \tskill{Riding}, \tskill{Thievery}, or \tskill{Acrobatics}. \pc

Fire Skills involve intelligence, knowledge and wisdom. A character's Fire level is his limit to spend points in \tskill{Infiltration}, \tskill{Perception}, \tskill{Medicine}, \tskill{Survival}, \tskill{Technology}, or \tskill{Wisdom}. \pc

Water Skills involve willpower and charisma. A character's Water level is his limit to spend points in \tskill{Willpower}, \tskill{Bluff}, \tskill{Handle Animal}, \tskill{Charisma}, \tskill{Performance}, or \tskill{Magic}.

\section{Jobs}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Each player character must choose a Main
Job and Secondary Job. Your Main Job determines
your HP and MP bonuses, and the type of gear you
can equip. Also, Main Jobs contain most active
Abilities, giving you different tools to contribute in
your Group, be it offensively, defensively or by
supporting the team. Secondary Jobs provide
reactions, increase your gear selection and can
provide several other abilities to cover up for your
weaknesses or to exploit your strong points.

Each job has several Core and Specialty
Abilities. Core Abilities are gained by all characters
with that Job, as soon as they have the necessary
character levels. Specialty Abilities are optional
choices; each character can choose one and only
one specialty for each of your abilities and can do
it at any time after getting the prerequisite levels.
However, after choosing a Specialty, the character
can no longer ``forget it'' or exchange it for another.

Regardless of its Job, the HP of a player character is equal to its Earth Stat value, plus the job bonus, and the MP of a player characters is equal its Water Stat value, plus the job bonus.

\subsection{Jobs Summary}

These ranks, are, however, just an approximation of each Job's Abilities. If you want to build your White Mage
as an offensive character, go ahead! Also, they do not cover each possible interaction between all Main and Secondary Jobs. An Archer/Rune Knight plays and feels different in battle than an Archer/Phalanx, for example. So, don't worry about choosing the “right classes” – just pick up the ones you'd like to play, and you'll surely will find good Abilities to use. Also, keep in mind that the only thing your Job influences is your combat ability – you have no roleplaying or character concept limitation due to your Job.
