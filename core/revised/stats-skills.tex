\section{Stats and Skills}\label{sec:stats}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsection{Stats}\label{subsec:stats}
Characters have four Stats, each connected to a crystal --- Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Each Stat has a value and levels. For every 10 points in its value, the Stat earns another level. Stat's value varies from 0 to 255 and, consequently, between 0 and 25 levels. The sum of a character’s Stat levels is his Character level. \pc%

For example, a 30th level character may have Earth 52 (5th level), Air 108 (10th level), Fire 80 (8th level) and Water 75 (7th level). Each Stat has 6 skills associated to it. The sum of all Skill levels a character has in all skills linked to a particular Stat may not be higher than its Stat level. Thus, the above character has 10 points to spend in all skills but may not spend more than 5 points in Earth skills, no more than 8 points in Fire skills and no more than 7 points in Water Skills. \pc%

Stats are also used in the tactical combat system. Each roll in combat uses one Offensive and one Defensive Stat. Earth is usually the Offensive Stat for attacks that depends on the user's brute force and physicality and is the Defensive Stat to attacks that may be prevented by the defender's physical strength, health and muscle power. \pc%

Attacks that rely on the user's speed, finesse and skill use Air as its Offensive Stat. It is the Defensive Stat against attacks that may be evaded by the defender's reflexes and agility. A primarily Offensive Stat, Fire is used in attacks that rely on the user's intelligence and magical ability. If an attack may be avoided by the defender's insight, it uses Fire as it Defensive Stat. \pc%

Lastly, attacks that depends on the user's charisma and willpower to hit uses Water as its Offensive Stat. However, it is a mainly Defensive Stat, as attacks that may be resisted by the user's mental strength and magical defenses should use it. Besides its offense and defense implications, players should note that your Earth Value is added to your hit points (HP) and your Water Value is added to your magic points (MP) value. \pc%

Stats are increased using experience points. The cost to increase a Stat's value by a single point is one plus twice the Stat level. Thus, a Stat costs 1 experience point per Stat point while at level 0 (value from 0 to 9); 3 experience points per Stat point while at level 1 (value 10 to 19); 5 XP per Stat point while at level 2 (value 20 to 29); and so on. Starting on page~\pageref{tab:app-xp}, there is a table with the total XP cost for each Stat value. \pc%

\subsection{Skills}\label{subsec:skills}
\begin{ffcolpage}
Skills are tools that the characters have to overcome Challenges. Each Challenge must relate to a Skill. Each Skill level means the player may re-roll once a Challenge related to that Skill. For example, a character with 3 levels in Strength Skill can re-roll the d100 3 times to overcome Strength Challenges. \pc%

Earth Skills involve brute strength, toughness, physical prowess and bulk. A character's Earth level is his limit to spend points in \tskill{Strength}, \tskill{Climbing}, \tskill{Swimming}, \tskill{Intimidation}, \tskill{Tolerance}, or \tskill{Jumping}. \pc%

Fire Skills involve intelligence, knowledge and wisdom. A character's Fire level is his limit to spend points in \tskill{Infiltration}, \tskill{Perception}, \tskill{Medicine}, \tskill{Survival}, \tskill{Technology}, or \tskill{Wisdom}. \pc%
