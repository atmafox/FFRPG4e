To use Geomancy, roll 1d100 and add your level. A result smaller than 60 casts a \textit{Minor Effect}; a result between 60 and 119 cast a \textit{Minor Effect} or a \textit{Major Effect}; and a result higher than 119 casts any effect.  You must choose which effect you'll cast after rolling the dice. In addition to the Geomancy’s normal  effects, a Druid of 10th level or higher may choose to spend MP to activate one of the action’s extra effects,  if they have the effect’s required level or greater. Geomancies are magical actions, and not Spells, but this  MP expenditure is affected by equipment and abilities that reduce Spells’ MP cost.

\subsection*{Geotrance}\label{subsec:geo-trance}

\begin{multicols}{2}


High level Geomancers can use their powers to conjure effects even when not in the correct terrain. To do this, use the terrain wheel: Plains <> Forest <> Mountain <> Snow <> Sea <> Swamp <> Urban <> Underground <> Lava <> Desert <> Plains. When using \taction{Geotrance}, you choose which terrain you will conjure and, for each “step” away in the terrain wheel, apply a cumulative 1 phase channeling the effect, in addition to the normal Slow (2) of the regular Geomancy. For example, a character in a Swamp wants to use a Lava effect. His \taction{Geotrance} is Slow (5) (Swamp (2) > Urban (3) > Underground: (4) > Lava: (5)). Similarly, if the character is in a Forest and wants a Desert effect, \taction{Geotrance} will be Slow (4) (Forest (2) > Plain (3) > Desert (4)). Cosmic is out of the terrain wheel and can’t be used with \taction{Geotrance}. If the Geomancer is in a Cosmic terrain, they may use \taction{Geotrance} to any other terrain as a Slow (4) action.
