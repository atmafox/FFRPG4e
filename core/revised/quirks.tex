Quirks are characteristics that define your character's personality and/or backstory. They give the player some tips on how to roleplay their character and are a tool both to earn Destiny Points and to use them. Some Quirk also got a keyword. You may not have more than one quirk with the same keyword, so you can't be Caustic and Empathic at the same time. And absolutely no Half-Viera/Half-Elvaan, please! \pc%

Destiny Points are a shared group resource that may be used to give the players some control in the narrative. They may be used to turn a failed Challenge into a successful one, to give tips and directions, to perform heroic actions that surpass human capacity and even to cheat death, among various other uses. Details on how to earn and how to spend Destiny Points are on the~\nameref{sec:destiny} section, starting at page~\pageref{sec:destiny}.

Their ears are like those of a cat or a dog. Despite having wings, they can't fly, but their pompoms give almost telepathic abilities with other moogle, building what some scholars call Mognet. You may spend Destiny Points to gather information or send messages through Mognet to other moogle. However, their spoken language heavily depends on the kupo word, which can have several meanings depending on the intonation and body movements. Because of this, communication with other races is full of misunderstandings. Whenever this causes you problems, earn Destiny Points.
\end{ffcolpage} \pw%

\begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Naive Idealist}: You see life through the lens of a personal code of conduct, or some religious fanaticism, or an ideological utopia.

\begin{wrapfigure}{i}{0.35\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{race-viera}
\end{wrapfigure}
\noindent\tquirk{Viera (racial)}: The Viera have two sub-races. The most common live in temperate forests and have long rabbit ears, but there is a sub-race that lives in tropical jungles and has feline characteristics rather than rabbit’s. This sub-breed is commonly called Mithra or Miqo'te. Regardless of the sub-race, they are mostly female, with males being only about twenty percent of the population. Moreover, they are closely linked to the forests and jungles where they live. You may use Destiny Points to communicate with trees, although their cognitive ability is very limited. On the other hand, you feel extremely uncomfortable in urban environments, and can even become ill if you stay away from the natural environment for a long time. Whenever this causes you problems, earn Destiny Points. \pw%
\end{ffcolpage}

\begin{ffcolpage}
\tquirk{Visions}: For some reason, you have visions that can give you hints of the future or just torture you. Spend Destiny Points for good visions and earn Destiny Points when flashbacks cause you trouble.
\end{ffcolpage} \pw%

\begin{ffcolpage}
You may also want to create your own Quirks. Choose a trait that defines your character and talk with your GM to turn into a Quirk. However, there are three guidelines that should be followed. First, a Quirk must be able to provide the player ways to spend Destiny Points to overcome Challenges; second, a quirk must be able to provide the GM ways to create problems for the group; and lastly, a quirk may not influence tactical combat rolls.
