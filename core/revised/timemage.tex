\begin{jobdesc}[name=pjob-timemage]
    A magician expert in time and cosmic magic, able to manipulate the battlefield and use spells that support its allies and hinder its enemies. Like all magicians, its main stats are Fire and Water. Its spells can change the flow of battle, but ultimately the power of the Time Mage relies not in winning the battles directly, but indirectly giving the party the tools to do so. The list of Spells and its description are in the~\nameref{sec:magic-time} section, starting at page~\pageref{sec:magic-time}. \pc%
