Small Adjustements
==================

### Status Effects

This change is intended to open more status possibilities and speed up
play.

-   **Blind** changes to \"Whenever you attack, roll your attack roll
    twice and take the worst roll.\"

-   New Status Effect: **Curse:** \"Whenever you get attacked, the
    attacker may reroll once.\"

**Curse** is a Negative Weaken-type status. In regard to Invention, it
is a level 1 status.

-   The *Curse* Spell (black magic) inflicts the **Mute**, **Curse** and
    **Immobilize** statuses instead of its original effects.

-   *Darkness Dance* (performance) inflicts the **Curse** status, not
    the **Blind** status.

-   Change Bad Breath and Diabolo\'s effects to:

1-2: **Immobilize, Mute, Poison, Meltdown.**\
3-4: **Blind, Disable, Curse, Slow.**\
5-6: **Curse, Slow, Virus, Toad.**\
7-8: **Confuse, Condemn, Slow, Poison.**\
9-0: **Berserk, Blind, Poison, Zombie.**

### 

### Artist

Artist\'s versatility is too high, so I\'m taking it down a peg by
changing some of its specialties:

-   *Ecletic Artist* changes to \"Choose one first level Dance, Song or
    Mimicry. You may use it, even without the required action.\"

-   *Perfectionism* changes to \"Choose one second level Dance, Song or
    Mimicry. You may use it, even without the required action.\"

-   *Multitalented* changes to \"Choose one third level Dance, Song or
    Mimicry. You may use it, even without the required action.\"

-   *Artistic Mastery* changes to \"Choose one fourth level Dance, Song
    or Mimicry. You may use it, even without the required action.\"

### 

### Druid

-   Druid\'s *Primal Music* Specialty should read \"Increase your HP and
    MP bonus multipliers by 1 each. You may equip the Instruments weapon
    type.\"

This was in the playtest packet but somehow didn\'t made it to the final
book. The version on the book is wrong and makes no sense with the
intended meaning.

There is an unintended interaction between *Martial Channeling* and
**!Kuuton**, so I\'m adding this caveat to *Martial Channeling*:

-   *Martial Channeling* may not increase the damage of multi-attack
    actions like **Branch Spear** and **!Kuuton**.

Also, *Supernova* (Blue Magic) is a tad underpowered, so I\'m changing
it to this:

-   *Supernova* costs 175 MP. Roll (Fire or Water) vs Water, difficulty
    70, against the enemy group. Should you hit all targets, regain the
    MP spent, up to 100 MP, and you may act again. Should you miss at
    least one target, instead, deal 9 x character level non-elemental
    magical damage to all targets you missed. This Spell ignores the
    **Reflect, Blind, Premonition, Curse, Shell** and **Blink**
    statuses.

Job Reworks
===========

These Job reworks completely overwrite the original Job description and
abilities from the Revised Edition Core Rulebook.

#### Adept

Several Adept actions enable you to spend HP based on your maximum or
current HP. In these cases, you lose current hit points equal to the
value listed in ability, but it does not diminish your maximum HP. Its
main Stats are Fire and Earth. All Adept's abilities deal damage based
on weapon damage, so equipping a strong weapon is a must.
